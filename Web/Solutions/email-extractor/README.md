# Email - Gmail Extractor
You can use it in order to export emails from a file. This file can be .mbox .vcf .txt or anything that a text editor can read. I use it in order to export all the email addresses from my Gmail account!

### How it works:
- Enter the file with the emails inside this folder
- Open the file file-to-email-extractor.py
- Enter the name of the file that has the emails inside (eg. gmailemails.mbox)
- Wait until it finish. If the file is big it can take up to 30 minutes or maybe more!
- When it will finish you will have a new file inside your folder with the name filename.emails.txt

### Blocklist:
In file-to-email-extractor.py there is a mlist named blockedList. There you can add all the email exceptions you want.
